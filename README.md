# NLP_Assignment

individual/pair assignment with classmate: Federico

In the script "Sirius", we are going to process the data and build the machine learning model to detect if the given data is real or fake news.

To make the code format clean and reproduceable, let's put all the data preparation steps inside the function "prepare_data(data)".

## Things we need to do:
-1.tokenize the title and text
-2.eliminate the stopwords(not sure if this part is necessary)
-3.transform words into numbers(not sure how to do it at this moment)
-4.regarding to the previous one, do we need to prepare a matrix with all the possible words? 
-5.maybe extra features? Like the length of the title, length of the text?
-6.which model to use? Random Forest? Logistic Regression? Neural Network?
